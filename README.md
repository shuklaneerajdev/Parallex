The basic principle of parallex scroll is one image rolling over the other.
To achieve this in a webpage, we do the following thing-
<ul>
<li>
  Keep one image fixed somewhere.
</li>
<li>
 With respect to the above image we have to move another image as the user scrolls through. This is done by ensuring there are other images on the page so that the use can scroll.
 The size of these other images should be kept large enough to fill the whole screen so that we don't need too many images and so that the user does not get too much confused.
</li>
</ul>
